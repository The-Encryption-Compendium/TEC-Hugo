<p>
  Encryption provides security and ensures user privacy on the internet.
  However, encryption can also complicate law enforcement's job, making it
  difficult to investigate cybercrimes or obtain intelligence on issues related
  to national security. This frames the encryption policy debate as being user
  privacy set against national security. Often these debates lack input from
  different resources, and they happen over and over again with the same debate
  points being applied to an evolving technological landscape.
</p>

<p>
  Our mission is to serve as central hub for policy makers, law practitioners,
  and the general public to understand the encryption debate. We have put
  together a comprehensive collection of research relating to the main themes of
  the encryption policy debate in the United States from 1970-2020.
